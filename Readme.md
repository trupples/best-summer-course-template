# BEST Course in Summer template website

Built with [Astro](https://astro.build/).

Change these:
* Course title
* Course description
* Useful info: dates, fee, etc.
* Organizer contacts: photos, names, roles, everything

## Development

To work on this site, make sure you have node and npm installed. In this folder, first install dependencies

```
npm install
```

and then, to run

```
npm run dev
```

In this mode, changes should be automagically pushed to the client and you don't even need to refresh :)

## Build

```
npm install
npm run build
```

The contents of the `dist/` folder contain the buit, hopefully javascript-less website :)
